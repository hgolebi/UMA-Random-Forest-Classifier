# UMA-Random-Forest-Classifier
Random forest classifier with tournament attribute selection. Project made for Machine learning classes on Politechnika Warszawska

During random forest classifier creation each tree uses tournament selection for every attribute in the decision node. This mean that 2 attributes are chosen randomly and the better one is set to be the next decision factor.
Project was created for learning purposes and the goal was to compare this form of selection with classic implementation.
